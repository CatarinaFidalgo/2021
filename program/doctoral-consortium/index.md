<h1>Doctoral Consortium</h1>

<p style="color:red;">
    The DC is a concentrated full-day event where students present their research interests/plans/results to a panel of senior researchers in the field and receive specific constructive feedback, followed by a reception in the evening and networking opportunities during the following days. Accepted students will give in-depth presentations of their research and will receive constructive comments from mentors. Additionally, accepted students will create a poster about their work to allow IEEE VR attendees to quickly familiarize themselves with each otherâ€™s work and to be shown to a broader audience during the conference poster session.
