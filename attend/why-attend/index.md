    <h1>Why attend IEEE VR 2021?</h1>
    <p>
        The IEEE Conference on Virtual Reality and 3D User Interfaces (IEEE VR) is the premier international event for the presentation of research results in the broad area of virtual reality (VR). IEEE VR brings together leaders, innovators, and influencers to disseminate the latest virtual reality research and advancements being developed from around the world.
    </p>
    <p>
        Since 1993, IEEE VR has presented groundbreaking research and accomplishments by virtual reality pioneers: scientists, engineers, designers, and artists, paving the way for the future. A globally recognized event for introducing the next big advancements in VR, IEEE VR 2021 will feature oral presentations, posters, research demos, and workshops.

        We are committed to providing the best virtual experience possible. IEEE VR will be an all-online format, and we will use video streams and web-based 3D spaces to host all conference activities. While some contributions (e.g., paper presentations) are better suited to streaming and online presentation than others (e.g., demos), we are planning to have all original content planned for VR 2021, from papers and posters to demos and videos, to workshops and the 3DUI contest, take place in the online format. Attendees will be able to interact with other scientists, practitioners, organizations, and innovators through the <a href="https://immersivelrn.org/ilrn-virtual-campus/">immersive Learning Research Network (iLRN)</a> and <a href="https://discord.com">Discord</a>.
