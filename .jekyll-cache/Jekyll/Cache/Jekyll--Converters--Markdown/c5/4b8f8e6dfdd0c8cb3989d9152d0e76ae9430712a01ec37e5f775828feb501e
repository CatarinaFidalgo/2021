    <h2 id="Overview">Overview</h2>
    <p>
        The 28th IEEE Conference on Virtual Reality and 3D User Interfaces 2021 seeks research demonstrations from laboratories or research groups (academic, government, or industry). Demos should interest the broad XR community and be presentable in a conference setting exhibiting new and innovative work. The conference will provide basic infrastructure. Additionally, authors of accepted demos will present an overview in a fast-forward research demonstration session to summarize their demo and relate it to research being performed at their lab.    
    </p>


    <h2 id="submission-guidelines">Submission Guidelines</h2>
    <p>
        A demo proposal should include:
        <ul>
            <li>A two-page extended abstract in PDF format describing the demo and the research itself. This will be published in the conference proceedings. Please provide the abstract in IEEE format, see below.</li>
            <li>A schematic of the layout (a separate document detailing the size and showing components such as projectors, cameras, etc. and describing any special support needed).</li>
            <li>A video showing the demo in action (the URL should be included in the proposal – preferably YouTube or Vimeo). This video could also be submitted to the IEEE Videos Track for separate consideration. (Please refer to the IEEE Videos Call for formatting and deadlines.)</li>
        </ul>
