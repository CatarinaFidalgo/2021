    This year, the IEEE VR 2021 will hold the 12th annual 3DUI Contest. It is open to anyone interested in 3D User Interfaces (3DUIs) and Virtual Reality, from researchers to students, enthusiasts, and professionals. The purpose of the contest is to stimulate innovative and creative solutions to challenging 3DUI problems. The theme of this year is ‚ÄúChallenging Pandemics‚Äù. Participants need to create and submit a 3DUI project that addresses the current COVID-19 situation directly, or indirectly. This may include VR/AR/MR driven 3DUI systems related to training, teaching, treatment support, or therapy support. Due to the current situation, we specifically do not request or make it a prerequisite to include user evaluations.
