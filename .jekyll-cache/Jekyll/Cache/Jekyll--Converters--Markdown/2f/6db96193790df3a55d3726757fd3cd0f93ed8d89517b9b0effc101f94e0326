<h2 id="overview"> Overview </h2>
<p>
    IEEE VR 2021 seeks original, high-quality papers in all areas related to virtual reality (VR), including augmented reality (AR), mixed reality (MR), and 3D user interfaces (3DUIs).
</p>

<h2 id="submission-guidelines"> Submission Guidelines </h2>

<p>
    Each research paper should be a validated contribution covering one or more of four styles of papers methodological, technology, applications, or systems. Papers are welcome that provide contributions in more than one of these areas. Authors should select a primary designation for submissions:

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Methodological papers</strong> should describe advances in theories and methods of AR/VR/MR and 3DUI, such as ethical issues, theories on presence, or human factors.</li>
        <li><strong>Technology papers</strong> should describe advancements in algorithms or devices critical to AR/VR/MR and 3DUI development such as input, display, user interaction, or tracking.</li>
        <li><strong>Application papers</strong> provide an important insight to the community by explaining how the authors built upon existing ideas and applied them to solve an interesting problem in a novel way. </li>Each paper should include an evaluation of the success of the use of AR/VR/MR and 3DUI in the given application domain.
        <li><strong>System papers</strong> should indicate how the developers integrated techniques and technologies to produce an effective system, and convey any lessons learned in the process.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>
    Each paper should include an evaluation of its contributions appropriate to its type (e.g., user study, case study, expert user feedback, system comparisons, technical benchmarking).
</p>

<p>
    We welcome paper submissions between 4 and 8 pages, <strong>NOT including</strong> references. Note that there are no distinct categories for short papers or technotes. The contribution of the paper will be weighed against its length during review. All submissions will receive at least three reviews by experts in the field to ensure quality of accepted submissions. All accepted submissions must be presented orally at the conference. Conference Papers will appear in the Proceedings of IEEE VR and be archived in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library. Starting from 2018 the Conference Paper track is distinct from the Journal Paper track.
</p>

<p>
    Authors are asked to identify one or more broad topic areas for each submission. It is understood that these topic areas overlap, and authors should identify primary and, if necessary, secondary broad topic areas (#1, #2 or #3 below) by priority within the submission system. Authors should note that the conference paper chairs will use this information only to assist with assigning the most appropriate reviewers while also balancing reviewer workload. Reviewers will also indicate similar broad topic area priorities based on their expertise. There is no quota for the number of accepted submissions per topic area, and the overall program will be based on the highest quality contributions to the field as judged across all topics.
</p>
