    <p>
        Poster submissions must be in English and anonymous. The submission must be in the form of a two-page summary paper with a maximum 100-word abstract. Supplemental material, such as a poster draft or videos may be submitted as well, but are not mandatory. All submitted materials must be in PDF format with embedded fonts. Two-page paper will be included in the proceedings and will be archived in the IEEE Digital Library, and therefore must be formatted using the IEEE Computer Society format described at <a href="http://junctionpublishing.org/vgtc/Tasks/camera.html">http://junctionpublishing.org/vgtc/Tasks/camera.html</a>. Poster papers must be submitted through a special poster slot available at the online submission site - <a href="https://new.precisionconference.com/submissions">https://new.precisionconference.com/submissions</a>. 
        Supplemental materials can be uploaded to the submission site as well. Poster drafts and final posters should be in portrait format with a maximum size given by the A0 standard (841 x 1189 mm; or 33.1 x 46.8 in). This year, every accepted poster would submit a 30-second teaser video. This video would not have sound, but would have captions.
