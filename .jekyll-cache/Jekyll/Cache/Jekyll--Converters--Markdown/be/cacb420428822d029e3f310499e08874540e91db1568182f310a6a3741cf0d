    <p>
        Tutorials are an excellent opportunity to offer education in topics in our field for both novice and experienced researchers.

        Proposed tutorials may be introductory or advanced and should address topics of interest to the extended reality communities (virtual, mixed, or augmented reality), as well as the 3D user interface community. Proposals will be evaluated on their relevance to the conference topics, their suitability for presentation in a tutorial format, and the qualifications of the instructors.

Upon review of submitted proposals, suggestions may be provided by the Tutorials chairs to submitters on how to improve their submission. Suggested topics include but are not limited to:
