    <p>
        The 28th IEEE Conference on Virtual Reality and 3D User Interfaces 2021 seeks poster submissions, which describe recently completed work, highly relevant results of work in progress, or successful systems and applications, in all areas related to virtual reality, including augmented reality (AR), mixed reality (MR), and 3D user interfaces.
    </p>
    <p>
        Presenting a poster is a great way to get feedback on work that has not yet been published. A combination of local and remote poster presentations will be an integral part of the conference, with sessions for interactive discussion between presenters and attendees for at least two days, plus a fast-forward presentation track where authors can orally present a brief summary of their work to all conference attendees. Note that, in order to maintain interactive and exciting poster presentations, we require at least one presenter per accepted poster to attend the conference (in person or virtually).
