    <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
    <p>
        We invite individuals or teams interested in organizing such a workshop to submit proposals that will work well in an online format for IEEE VR 2021. Since IEEE VR 2021 is going to be fully virtual, we are encouraging workshop submissions that fit well with an online format that maximizes engagement. Although longer workshops will be considered, we encourage shorter efficient workshops, or workshops split over sessions spanning two or more days with long breaks between sessions in order reduce video-conference fatigue and to provide attendees time to reflect between sessions.
    </p>
    <p>
        Workshops are intended to bring together researchers, developers, technology providers, practitioners and users for a lively and interactive discussion of issues through an informal exchange of ideas and information. Workshops may target a specific application area, a specific research area, or a topic of general interest. Workshops should be more than just a mini conference of paper presentations. Workshops may include, but are not limited to:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>A focus on creating and exchanging of new ideas and opportunities to meet new people</li>
        <li>A balance of formal presentations with informal discussion and ideation</li>
        <li>Emphasis on attendee participation and interactive discussions</li>
        <li>Thought experiments and playing with ideas</li>
        <li>Curated panels</li>
        <li>Position papers</li>
        <li>Recorded sessions prepared in advance of the conference for attendees to watch at their convenience before live workshop discussion</li>
        <li>VR experiences for attendees to try remotely before live workshop discussion</li>
        <li>Live application development by both speakers and attendees</li>
        <li>Inclusive VR and geographical diversity</li>
        <li>Creative ways of supporting participation across different time zones</li>
        <li>Breakout groups and presentation of ideas generated by the groups</li>
        <li>A summary session concluding with lessons learned, insights gained, and new ideas generated from the workshop</li>
        <li>Continued discussion after the conference. </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Proposals are welcome on topics that have been previously addressed; in addition, new topics, approaches, or insights are especially appreciated. Submissions should include a statement indicating how the proposal differs from recent tutorial presentations that may have approached a similar topic, or why it is important to offer it again. Topics taken from the list of suggested topics appropriate for paper submissions to the main conference are also welcome. Proposals for tutorials should be submitted electronically (PDF) and should include:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Title</li>
        <li>Expected duration (90 minute or half-day)</li>
        <li>A brief description of the topics to be addressed, including time allotted to each (roughly 500 words)</li>
        <li>The technical level and intended audience</li>
        <li>The expected value to that audience</li>
        <li>If the tutorial has been delivered before, include a description of where and when, and explain why it should be held again. This is required regardless of whether the proposers organized the previous tutorials themselves or the previous tutorials were taught by someone else.</li>
        <li>The names, contact information and a short biography (roughly 200 words each) for the proposed instructors.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Tutorial submissions must be submitted via email to the Tutorials Chairs at tutorials2021 [at] ieeevr.org.
    </p>
    <p>
        For each 90 minute accepted tutorial, we will be able to provide a free one-day registration for the day of the tutorial, and two one-day registrations for the day of the tutorial for each half-day accepted tutorial.
