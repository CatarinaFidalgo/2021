    <p>
        This year, the IEEE VR 2021 will hold the 12th annual 3DUI Contest. It is open to anyone interested in 3D User Interfaces (3DUIs) and Virtual Reality, from researchers to students, enthusiasts, and professionals. The purpose of the contest is to stimulate innovative and creative solutions to challenging 3DUI problems. The theme of this year is ‚ÄúChallenging Pandemics‚Äù. Participants need to create and submit a 3DUI project that addresses the current COVID-19 situation directly, or indirectly. This may include VR/AR/MR driven 3DUI systems related to training, teaching, treatment support, or therapy support. Due to the current situation, we specifically do not request or make it a prerequisite to include user evaluations.
    </p>

    <p>We expect the following functionality:
        <ul>
            <li>One or multiple potential users should be benefit from the 3DUI by receiving information or support in the COVID-19 context</li>
            <li>3D interaction and feedback metaphors should act as mechanics to support this experience</li>
            <li>The project should present novel 3DUI and can focus on a technical contribution</li>
            <li>The simulation could be played standalone, or networked. A user should be able to experience the application for about 15 minutes</li>
            <li>Optionally, the project could include an evaluation or the reporting of performance metrics</li>
            <li>Optionally, the system could be collaborative</li>
            <li>Optionally, you could provide a downloadable version for IEEE VR attendants.</li>
            <li>Optionally, you can embed your interactions inside an online game/simulation.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Selected contestants will be required to provide a live demonstration of their solutions (virtually) using their own mixed reality hardware (VR, AR, or anything in between), but can choose to use any type of hardware. A grand winner will be selected by juries at the conference.
